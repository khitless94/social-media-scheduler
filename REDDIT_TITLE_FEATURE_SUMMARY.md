## Database Changes Required

### Posts Table Migration
A new `title` column needs to be added to the `posts` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN title TEXT;
COMMENT ON COLUMN posts.title IS 'Title for Reddit posts (required for Reddit platform)';
```

**Migration file created:** `add-title-to-posts-table.sql`
**Instructions:** `run-title-migration.md`

## UI Features

### Title Input Field
- Only appears when Reddit platform is selected
- Required field validation for Reddit posts
- Character limit: 300 characters
- Character counter display
- Placeholder text: "Enter your Reddit post title (required)..."

### Validation
- Reddit posts require a title (validation in both immediate posting and scheduling)
- Clear error messages when title is missing
- Form reset includes clearing the title field

## Backend Integration

### API Support
The backend already supports title parameter:
- `supabase/functions/post-to-social-media/index.ts` - ✅ Supports title
- `supabase/functions/post-to-social/index.ts` - ✅ Supports title
- Reddit API implementation uses title correctly

### Request Body Format
When posting to Reddit, the request now includes:
```javascript
{
  content: "post content",
  platform: "reddit",
  title: "post title",
  // other fields...
}
```
