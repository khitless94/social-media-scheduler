## âœ… **Step 2: Verify App Status**

### Check App Review Status:
1. In LinkedIn Developer Console â†’ Your App
2. Go to **Products** tab
3. Ensure **Sign In with LinkedIn** is added and approved

### App Settings:
- App Type: Should be **Business** or **Consumer**
- Company: Must be associated with a valid LinkedIn company page
- Privacy Policy URL: Must be provided
- Terms of Service URL: Must be provided

## âœ… **Step 3: Environment Variables Check**

The following environment variables should be set in Supabase:

```

## âœ… **Step 4: Test the Fix**

1. Save all LinkedIn app changes
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for LinkedIn to propagate changes
