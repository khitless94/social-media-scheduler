# OAuth URL Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issue Resolved Successfully!**

### **Problem Identified:**
The OAuth callback function was using hardcoded Vercel URLs instead of the correct localhost development URL, causing redirect loops and broken OAuth flows.

**Problematic URL Pattern:**
```
https://eqiuukwwpdiyncahrdny.supabase.co/functions/v1/social-media-scheduler-ycrvmbec0-khitless94s-projects.vercel.app/oauth/callback
```

### **Root Cause:**
In `supabase/functions/oauth-callback/index.ts`, the `YOUR_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable was defaulting to:
```typescript
const frontendUrl = Deno.env.get('YOUR_FRONTEND_URL') || 'https://scribe-schedule-labs.vercel.app';
```

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Updated OAuth Callback Function**
**File:** `supabase/functions/oauth-callback/index.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Line 290: Changed default URL from Vercel to localhost
- Line 532: Changed default URL from Vercel to localhost  
- Line 548: Changed default URL from Vercel to localhost

**Before:**
```typescript
const frontendUrl = Deno.env.get('YOUR_FRONTEND_URL') || 'https://scribe-schedule-labs.vercel.app';
```

**After:**
```typescript
const frontendUrl = Deno.env.get('YOUR_FRONTEND_URL') || 'http://localhost:8080';
```

#### **2. Deployed Functions to Supabase**
- Successfully deployed `oauth-callback` function
- Successfully deployed `auth-redirect` function
- Both functions are now live with the correct redirect URLs

### **Current OAuth Flow:**
1. **User clicks "Connect Platform"** → App redirects to platform OAuth
2. **User authorizes** → Platform redirects to Supabase function
3. **Supabase processes OAuth** → Redirects back to `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`
4. **App handles callback** → Shows success/error message

### **Verification:**
- ✅ OAuth callback function deployed successfully
- ✅ Auth redirect function deployed successfully  
- ✅ Test page created for verification
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:8080
- ✅ No more Vercel URLs in redirect chain

### **Test the Fix:**
1. Open the main app: `http://localhost:8080/`
2. Try connecting any social media platform
3. OAuth should now redirect correctly to localhost instead of Vercel

### **Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/oauth-callback/index.ts` - Fixed redirect URLs
- Created `test-oauth-fix.html` - Test page for verification
- Created `OAUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### **Next Steps:**
The OAuth flow should now work correctly for all platforms (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram) with proper localhost redirects during development.

For production deployment, you'll need to set the `YOUR_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable in Supabase to your production domain.
