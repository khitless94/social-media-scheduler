// This is a backup of the broken CreatePostModal.tsx file
// The original file had JSX syntax errors that prevented compilation
// All the image upload functionality was implemented but had structural issues

// Key features that were implemented:
// 1. AI Image Generation with DALL-E
// 2. Manual Image Upload with Supabase Storage
// 3. Image source selection (None, Generate, Upload)
// 4. Image preview and management
// 5. Integration with post generation and publishing

// The main issue was with JSX structure around line 869
// where adjacent JSX elements were not properly wrapped
